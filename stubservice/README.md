learnangularjs:stubservice
==========================

Stub implementation of the Tasks service (from the 'service' sub-project), to enable fast feedback for development of the AngularJS-based
browser client (as well as other future clients like native mobile applications).

It uses [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) and [Express](http://expressjs.com/) (a Sinatra-like JavaScript framework).

The stub service can either return responses based on routes set up in stubservice.js, or from static files in the 'static' directory.
