learnangularjs:client
=====================

AngularJS single page web application that acts as a client for the JSON-over-HTTP service.

Unit and end-to-end tests run using the recommended AngularJS test runner, [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.com/).
The end-to-end scenario tests can run against either the 'real' service or the stub service.

[NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) and [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) are required to run tests.
The node packages used will be automatically downloaded by Gradle using npm.

Layout is handled by [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).
